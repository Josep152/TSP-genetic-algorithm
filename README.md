# TSP-genetic-algorithm

The present repository stores a Genetic Algorithm implementation to find out the best path without intersections after a bunch of generations.

### Install libraries 

This project make use of tkinter python library for graphic interfaces, so install it if you haven't before.

```
$ pip install tk
```

### Running the project

After compiling c++ file:

'''
$ g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
'''

We have to run them as normally (by the way, this project doesn't make use of setups):

```
$ ./main.exe
$ ./main.py
```

You'll get a first window of node's connections, then you'll see a second one showing the best path after the application of the Genetic Algorithm. And finally, you'll have a a graphic representation about the best genome and the means through generations.
